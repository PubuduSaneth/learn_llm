**Understand:**

- Why the filed of language modeling needed LLMs?
- What are LLMs?
- How do LLMs differ from other machine learning approaches?

## Language modeling (LM)

- LM was introduced in early 1980s with the introduction of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- With the advances in the field of LM, more advance techniques to RNNs were introduced to
  - preserve gradients and maintain information (1997-2014; Gating mechanisms)
  - handle long-term memory (2015; Attention for RNNs)
  - manage variable-length input output sequences (2014; Encoder-decoder for RNNs)

### Why does the LM field needs LLMs?

- RNNs process inputs sequentially and the attention mechanism was not build into the core architecture
- RNNs are slow and lead to scalability challenges
- Transformer technology introduced in the paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) addressed this limitations in Modern RNNs
- Transformer technology (therefore LLMs) eliminate sequential dependency:
  - all positions can be computed in parallel
  - Scalable model training and inference

## LLMs

Transformer-based neural networks with large number of parameters (billions to trillions) that employ self-attention mechanisms and trained on vast amounts data (billions to trillions of tokens)

### LLMs vs other ML approaches

- Behavior of traditional ML approaches are specifically tied to the training objectives
- LLMs exhibits capabilities that were not explicitly trained
  - i.e., Simple training objectives lead to complex capabilities
  - e.g., LLM’s ability to translate despite never being specifically trained for translation
- These capabilities are referred "Emergent Behavior" of LLMs
- This complexity emerges from:
  - Large scale + rich data + powerful architecture
  - Emergent mechanism is still not fully understood
